Simple currency converter
Can use for reference in converting money you have available or expect to have.  No API Key present, but can obtain a free one from base url.  
With an initial input of base currency, will produce a json directory of currencies in given list.  
Will need to double check if it only gets from available currencies in CURRENCIES list or from available currencies from base url.
Was created for simple practice and understanding of API keys, request urls and producing tables from website data.
